I'm a game developer as a hobby, and basically I try to suck less at it each day.

<h1 class="heading">Cryptography</h1>
<p>
Cryptography is my current project and is still in very early development.
It will be a procedually generated dungeon crawler with a variety of playstyles, including stealth strategy and just going in and killing everything.
Currently I am not providing a download link becuase there is not much to do. If you really want to though, you can find it along with all of my other projects on my github, <a href="https://github.com/xyag">here.</a>
<br />
<br />
I would post some screenshots but the game doesn't have too much at the moment, but I will get to it as soon as possible.

<h1 class="heading">Alien Infiltration</h1>
<p>
Instead of doing the <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Lundum Dare competition</a> since I was not inspired at all, I made a small little game in a day called Alien Infiltration.
It's one of those games that's very simple to pick up, but ramps up in difficulty fairly quickly. You just have to dodge incoming missiles as an invading flying saucer, but that's no easy task.
The missiles start coming faster and faster and move much more quickly aswell. You can get this one on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ceunon.AlienInfiltration">Google Play.</a>

<h1 class="heading">Bad Tower Defense</h1>
<p>
An older project, but still not as bad as the name implies. Bad Tower Defense really was just a test to see how to make a tower defense game.
Not too much to say here, except that you buy with left click and place with right click. Also, in the later rounds this game becomes insanely hard if not impossible past round 100. <a href="https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0Bw_hQeQENqnFZnMxdEtFeUMtUG8&export=download">Download.</a>
