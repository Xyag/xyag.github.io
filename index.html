<h1 class="heading">Can't Stump the Trump </h1>
<p>
In this game, you play as Donald Trump in his adventure to make America great again. Try and destroy wave after wave of your enemies while not getting stumped yourself.
Use a variety of weapons to decimate many kinds of oppenents, a couple of which are the Bush Bot and the Clinton Cucumber. No download link yet, but hopefully it will
be finished soon.

<h1 class="heading">Rokko</h1>
<p>
Rokko is one of my current projects. It's a procedurally generated dungeon crawler, but I'm not too sure what it will eventually evolve into. You play as a rock creatively named Rokko
who was banished to the dungeons of an ancient kingdom. Your two goals are to escape and find revenge as you discover the secrets of the dungeon. You can find it and all my other games
on my Github, <a href="https://github.com/xyag">here.</a>

<h1 class="heading">Alien Infiltration</h1>
<p>
Instead of doing the <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Lundum Dare competition</a> since I was not inspired at all, I made a small little game in a day called Alien Infiltration.
It's one of those games that's very simple to pick up, but ramps up in difficulty fairly quickly. You just have to dodge incoming missiles as an invading flying saucer, but that's no easy task.
The missiles start coming faster and faster and move much more quickly aswell. You can get this one on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Ceunon.AlienInfiltration">Google Play.</a>

<h1 class="heading">Bad Tower Defense</h1>
<p>
An older project, but still not as bad as the name implies. Bad Tower Defense really was just a test to see how to make a tower defense game.
Not too much to say here, except that you buy with left click and place with right click. Also, in the later rounds this game becomes insanely hard if not impossible past round 100. <a href="https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0Bw_hQeQENqnFZnMxdEtFeUMtUG8&export=download">Download.</a>
